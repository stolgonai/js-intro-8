Js Modules are used to increase code reusability within a framework.project as it allows creating reusable 
components in a file and export it to be used by other files.
Other files can import these reusable components and use.

There are 2 ways to achieve this reusability.
1. CommonJS (BEFORE ES6)
    module.exports is used to export components (properties, functions, classes)
    require is used to import reusable components in another file 

2. ES6 Modules 
    export 
    import 

fileA.js
    // properties - information
    const username = 'johndoeX';
    const password = 'test1234';
    const appURL = 'www.amazon.com';


    // functions 
    const login = (username, password) => {
        // Login code
    }

    fileB.js

 Test 1:
 Go to amazon.com
 Login with username and password 
 Validate you can purchase product   


fileC.js
Test 2:
 Go to amazon.com
 Login with username and password 
 Validate you can see all the previous orders


fileD.js
Test 3:
 Go to amazon.com
 Login with username and password 
 Validate you can change your password


fileE.js
Test 4:
 Go to amazon.com
 Login with username and password 
 Validate you can update your address

HOW TO EXPORT properties and functions with CommonJS?
WAY 1 - individual exports 
module.exports.password = password;
module.exports.username = username;
module.exports.appURL = appURL;
module.exports.login = login;


WAY 2 - exporting as an object
const loginInfo = {
    username,
    password,
    appURL,
    login
};

module.exports.loginInfo = loginInfo;


WAY 2 - Improved
module.exports.loginInfo = {
    username,
    password,
    appURL,
    login
};
HOW TO IMPORT properties and functions with CommonJS?
WAY 1 - individual imports 
const {password, username, appURL, login} = require('./fileA');

console.log(username);
console.log(password);
login();

WAY 2 - importing as an object
const loginInfo = require('./fileA');

console.log(loginInfo.username);
console.log(loginInfo.password);
console.log(loginInfo.appURL);
loginInfo.login();

ES6 Modules
-It is added a syntatic sugar on prev common js Modules
-Common JS is supported with olders versions mostly with NODE
-ES6 supported by new versions of Node and all the modern browsers

    -export is used to exports reusable components from a file
    -import ... from is used to import reusable components.

fileDriver.js
//properties
const driverName = "chrome";

//functions
function quitDriver(){
    //quitting driver
}
function getDriver(){
    //getting driver
}

You can export a class as well


Java - import
