ES6 Class GETTERS and SETTERS
Getters: are used to get properties of an object
Getters are mostly return type methods and usually they do not take argument unless necessary

Setters: are used to set properties of an object
Setters are mostly void type (not returning) and they mostly take arguments to be set as the new information

ADVANTAGES OF GETTERS AND SETTERS
-They provide programmer better control mechanism to access information and update information


Class is a template a blueprint can be used to crreate many objects.
Objects: They are instances of their classes

Class: Person;
Object: Suzanne, Ayca, John

Object Properties
- if each obj, has a different info, for a one property like name - this should be non static
- if a behaviour differs for object like, sound, like, each person differ from each other => this should be non-static 
-Every person shares the same info -> static property - belongs to Perso(Ayca, Suzanne, John) =>  we have 2 eyes
- Every object have a feature -> static function -> belongs to class -> breath

Static membes belongs to class and can be accessed with the className
Syntax: Class.propertty or class.function
-static members cannot be accessed with the objects

Non-static members belong to the objects and can only be accessed with the objects created 
Syntax: const obj = new Class();
        obj.property or obj.function()
-Non-static members cannot be accessed with the classNamen
