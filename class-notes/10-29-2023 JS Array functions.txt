Array Methods

-Array is a widely used data structure in any programming language.
-Data Structure: general term used for storing data in different data structures.

Mutable or modifying original arrays methods: 

1. PUSH adding element at the end. Also you can add multipple elmts at the end by coma.
Push return a new lenght of the arr

2. POP removing the last element and return that element.

3. SHIFT removes the first elem from the beginning and return that element

4. UNSHIFT accept an arg, and add an el at the beginning of arr, and return a new length of arr


SEARCHING ELEMENTS
5. Includes(arg) ==> check if an element exist or not, and return bolean answer, it takes 1 argument
    it does not change anything in original arr.

6. indexof(arg) --> check if the elemnts occur, and return index of first occurance of searching el. if el not found it returns -1
    it does not change anything in original arr.

7. lastIndexOf(arg) --> check if the elemnts occur, and return index of last occurance of searching el. if el not found it returns -1
    it does not change anything in original arr.

8. concat(arg) --> concat multiple arrays into one, it creates and returns a new array.
This method did not change an original arr

9. (...) --> spread a few arr into a new arr
returns a newr arr, did not change the original one

10. reverse() --> reversing elemnts inside original arr, does not accept arg, and it is changing/modifying an original arr, return modifyed arr. 

11. Slice() --> accept arguments as a start and ending indexes, and do not modify arr, return cutted elem, as an arr

12. splice(start position, how many removing, whats to include)it returns removed elements as an array. If there is no elements removed, then it returns an empty arr.
    it changes the original array.
